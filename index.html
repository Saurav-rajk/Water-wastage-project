            What is Water Wastage and How Does It Occur?
        </h2>
        <section class="advantages">
            <p class="p1">

                When talking about water waste, this can reference a few key areas. The water waste from a community of
                people is more commonly known as sewage. Household (or other buildings) wastewater can include the waste
                from toilets or from actions such as draining kitchen sinks.

                Simply using too much water can very easily be done by anyone. Running a very long shower, loading your
                washing machine too regularly or leaving the tap running when brushing your teeth are all examples of
                how easy it is to waste this valuable resource.

                In regard to sewage and wastewater from your pipes, damaging chemicals or cleaning products may be
                drained through your pipes, you may be using your sewage system too often, or it's always possible that
                large water treatment companies are not managing wastewater services in the best way to protect the
                environment.

                What is the Impact of Wastewater on the Environment?

                When considering the damage wastewater is capable of, the biggest threats to the environment are
                contamination and pollution. If sewage is not treated appropriately before being disposed of it, it can
                contaminate water and thereby put wildlife at great risk.

                Furthermore, wastewater dispersed through flooding or leaks means that completely untreated water can
                enter water sources and pollute them.

                The process of treating wastewater also requires fossil fuels. This means that wastewater treatment has
                the potential to increase carbon footprint and air quality.

                Global Water Wastage Statistics

                When considering the situation of water wastage and the earth's future, it's important to take into
                account daily water use and habits within other countries around the world. With these statistics, you
                can better understand how your own country (and therefore your own effort) is faring in comparison to
                other countries.

                These statistics can show a shocking difference between water use statistics based on different
                countries. his is an important reminder of how all countries across the world need to work cohesively to
                lower water wastage and help save the environment. We're all living on the same planet, after all.

                

                Belgium is the biggest daily consumer of water on average by individuals, with 7.406 liters. Kenya is
                the smallest daily consumer, with 50 liters.

                You might expect that the country to house the biggest water consumption on a daily basis would be the
                country to have the largest population: but China, which does have the world's largest population, has a
                smaller daily water consumption than Belgium.

                It just goes to show how each individual's water usage can make a significant difference.

                Countries such as Kenya are often struggling with a water crisis, which throws into sharp relief how
                valuable a commodity like water is. For countries on this list using a high amount of daily water,
                countries like Kenya, in comparison, are using very little simply because they do not have access to
                safe water.

                It's now more important than ever to preserve the water that the world does have.

                Rainwater harvesting has many benefits but the main one is that it is a sustainable water management
                practice that can be implemented by anyone on many different levels, from a simple rain barrel to a
                comprehensive rainwater harvesting system that integrates with an irrigation system or household
                plumbing <br>

                When you think about it… do we need to use municipally treated water to sprinkle on our lawns and
                landscaping? Definitely not! Harvested rainwater is the perfect candidate for irrigation use in addition
                to so many other water uses. By using rainwater harvesting systems to supply water for some, or all of
                our water needs, you can reduce our dependence on municipally treated water.
                <br>

                Overall, rainwater harvesting is viewed as a practice that is socially acceptable and environmentally
                responsible all the while, promoting self-sufficiency.
                <br>


                <span style="color:rgb(6, 52, 52);">WATER CONSERVATION BENEFITS OF RAINWATER HARVESTING</span>
                <br>
                The rainwater that falls on your roof and property is essentially free. All it takes is a method to
                harvest it into a tank or cistern for later use.
                Rainwater harvesting can be a great educational tool to get people to recognize their individual or
                household water usage. This can get them to start conserving water in other areas around their home.
                For communities that rely on imported water to supply their needs, collecting rainwater that falls
                naturally in the community can reduce the need for imported water.
                Rainwater harvesting helps utilities reduce peak demands during summer months, saving treated water for
                more important and appropriate water uses.
                While rainwater can be a perfect primary water source for many uses and situations, it is also a great
                backup water supply for emergency situations.
                <br><br>

                <span style="color:rgb(6, 52, 52);">THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF RAINWATER HARVESTING</span><br>
                Rainwater harvesting can reduce stormwater runoff from a property. The elimination of runoff can reduce
                contamination of surface water with pesticides, sediment, metals, and fertilizers.
                By reducing stormwater runoff, rainwater harvesting can reduce a storm’s peak flow volume and velocity
                in local creeks, streams, and rivers, thereby reducing the potential for streambank erosion.
                Rainwater harvesting systems can be employed as simple and effective methods to meet a municipality’s
                stormwater management program requirements of individual properties.
                It is an excellent source of water for plants and landscape irrigation since it has no chemicals such as
                fluoride and chloramines (chlorine). <br> <br>
                <span style="color:rgb(6, 52, 52);">THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS BENEFITS OF RAINWATER HARVESTING</span>
                <br>
                While the logical use of rainwater harvesting is for water conservation purposes, it also reduces energy
                use within a community.

                Typically, the end use of the rainwater is located on the property where the rainwater is collected.
                Replacing municipal water use at a home and property with rainwater reduces the amount of water that a
                municipality has to treat and then pump to your house. The treatment and pumping of municipally provided
                water require a lot of energy.
                The implementation of rainwater harvesting can help meet new standards of energy and water efficiency
                ratings and codes that are being developed in communities.

                The common sources of wastewater are domestic sewage wastewater and non-domestic wastewater. Here’s a
                brief lowdown
                <br>
                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">
                    Domestic Sewage</span><br>

                The wastewater created from homes, public toilets, hotels, resorts, motels, schools, religious
                institutions, hospitals, doctors’ clinics,
                sports centers, and apartments can be classified as domestic sewage wastewater. The mentioned
                institutions individually and collectively create
                significantly high levels of wastewater
                <br>
                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;"> Non-Domestic Water
                </span><br>

                This includes the wastewater created from floods, rainwater runoff, swimming pool water, garage water,
                and water from cleaning centers.
                Wastewater generated from salons, commercial kitchens, energy units, and agricultural facilities can
                also be classified into this category.

                So, in a way, the water used in both residential and commercial units will add to the volume of
                wastewater produced by the property.<br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">
                    Effects of Wastewater</span><br>

                As you’d probably guess at this stage, the impact of wastewater is devastating, to say the least. It
                adversely impacts the environment
                and ends up ruining the ecological balance.
                Its impact on human health is equally alarming. Here’s a shortlist of the worst effects of wastewater.
                <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Contamination of Habitat and Water
                </span><br>

                The first and the most pronounced impact of wastewater is the fact that it ends up contaminating and
                (eventually) destroying the natural habitats. Over time, the wildlife residing in these habitats are
                affected as they are under the exposure of harmful chemicals
                borne by the water. So, wastewater doesn’t just destroy habitats, but it also ends up killing the
                animals living there.

                    Harvesting</span><br>
                In urban areas, rainwater flows away as surface runoff. This runoff can be caught and used for
                recharging aquifers by adopting appropriate methods.. <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">2. Rooftop Rainwater
                    Harvesting</span><br>
                It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the
                catchment, and the rainwater is collected from the roof of the house/building.

                It can either be stored in a tank or diverted to an artificial recharge system. This method is less
                expensive and very useful and, if implemented correctly, helps in augmenting the groundwater level of
                the area. -->

                Wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants which include physical, chemical and biological
                treatment processes. Water that is no longer needed or is no longer suitable for use in bilge water that
                can be discharged back into the environment and it is formed by a number of activities including
                bathing, washing, using the toilet and rainwater runoff. Wastewater treatment is a process used to
                convert wastewater into an effluent outflowing of water to a receiving body of water that can be
                returned to the water cycle with minimal impact on the environment or directly reused. The principal
                objective of wastewater treatment is generally to allow human and industrial effluents to be disposed of
                without danger to human health or unacceptable damage to the natural environment. Wastewater treatment,
                also called sewage treatment, the removal of impurities from wastewater,
                or sewage, before they reach aquifers or natural bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, estuaries, and
                oceans

                <!-- <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Direct-Pumped
                    (Submersible)</span><br>
                This is the most common type of more professional rainwater harvesting system, particularly for domestic
                properties, and is generally the easiest to install. The pump is located within the underground tank and
                harvested water is simply pumped directly to the WCs or other appliances. If the tank should be in
                danger of running dry, a small amount of mains water is fed to it in order to maintain supply. For
                commercial projects, such systems tend to be dual pump arrangements (dutystandby). <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Direct-Pumped (Suction)</span> <br>
                This system differs in that the pump is not inside the tank, but instead is located within a control
                unit within the house (e.g. utility room). The unit also deals with the backup from mains water supply,
                so there is no need to send mains water down to the tank. <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Indirect Gravity</span><br>
                This type of system differs in that the harvested water is first pumped to a high level tank (header
                tank), then allowed to supply the outlets by gravity alone. With this arrangement, the pump only has to
                work when the header tank needs filling. Also the mains water is fed directly to the header tank, not
                into the main harvesting tank. <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Indirect Pumped</span> <br>
                This arrangement is similar to the above, except that the internal tank can be at any level in the
                building, as it does not rely on gravity to supply the outlets. Instead a booster pump set is used to
                provide a pressurised supply. This system employs the benefit of not having to feed mains back-up water
                to the underground tank, whilst also offering great flexibility as the booster pumps can be tailored to
                suit the flow and pressure requirements of the building. <br> -->
